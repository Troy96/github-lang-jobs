# Github Jobs (hackercamp18)
![Landing Page](https://github-langs-jobs.herokuapp.com//images/hackercamp.png)


A web app that accepts the Github UserID and displays the frequently used languages by user for the project repositories along with an option to view job opportunities on any language selected.

* Built in two days in the Hackercamp18 hackathon organized by Innovaccer in 2018
* Used Node.js for the backend runtime, Handlebars for templating and Heroku for hosting
* Currently the jobs section is broken. Need to replace the Github Jobs API with other alternative
